# NETFLIX-DEMO-PROJECT

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12

I build this project from scratch with Angular and with its native dependencies along with all custom Css for styling.
No other external liberaries, the only additional package is Angular-Youtube-Component.
The code of this project is not refactored, its based on the first-attempt, There is alot of room for refactoreing and improvment.
