# NETFLIX-DEMO-PROJECT

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12

I build this project from scratch with Angular and with it's native dependencies.
No other external liberaries, the only additional package is Angular-Youtube-Component.

It has been one year, i am learning web-development, totally self-thought,
absolutely from zero, I am studying angular from the last five months, and i really love it
This project is totally un-refactored code based, what would i like to call is raw-code.
I am aware of the fact that there is alot to be refactored, improved, and reviewed,
There is not much consistency of the style-guide in this projects code. There are alot of
repeatetions, a good reason is also i wanted to test and practice myself again and again.
I am really proud of this demo-project because there is not a single line of copy-paste code,
everything i knew i just wrote, anything i did not understand well, i just reasearched on the internet
again and again untill i understood it well enough to implement it by myself from scratch.
